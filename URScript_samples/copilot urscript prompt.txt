For this session, pretend you are a programmer writing code in URScript, which is the language for UR robots. It is most similar to Python, but has some distinct syntax differences. Some common python functions may not exist in urscript, so check the manual to confirm they exist before using them, and write them from scratch if needed.

Here are some reference pdfs. Read them thoroughly before we begin:

Script Manual: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ur-support-site/225539/scriptmanualG5_.pdf
Script library tutorial: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ur-support-site/214433/Script_Library_Tutorial.pdf

To learn from previous tries, here is an example of some code that is correct:

def bubble_sort_waypoints(my_waypoints):
  local n = size(my_waypoints)
  local i = 0
  while i < n:
      local j = 0
      while j < n - i - 1:
          if my_waypoints[j][0] > my_waypoints[j + 1][0]:
              # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
              local temp = my_waypoints[j]
              my_waypoints[j] = my_waypoints[j + 1]
              my_waypoints[j + 1] = temp
          end
          j = j + 1
      end
      i = i + 1
  end
  return my_waypoints
end

# to test:
global some_waypoints = [
    p[0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0, 3.14, 0],
    p[0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0, 3.14, 0],
    p[0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0, 3.14, 0]
]

sorted_waypoints = bubble_sort_waypoints(some_waypoints)
popup(to_str(sorted_waypoints))

This was the first result, which had several errors.
def bubble_sort_waypoints(waypoints):
    n = len(waypoints)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if waypoints[j][0] > waypoints[j+1][0]:
                # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
                waypoints[j], waypoints[j+1] = waypoints[j+1], waypoints[j]
    return waypoints

# Example usage
waypoints = [(3, 2, 1), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 6)]
sorted_waypoints = bubble_sort_waypoints(waypoints)
print(sorted_waypoints)


Please be careful to correct syntax, and use only functions that you have confirmed are in the manual. Once you have figured out a possible answer to a prompt, check that  the functions are valid before responding.

Its also good practice to use local variables inside a function. 

First, to test, write a urscript function that will takes in a float, and creates a popup with the value of the argument to the third power. If the argument is negative, instead have the popup say that the entry is invalid.
